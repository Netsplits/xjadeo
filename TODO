TODO
----

complete the qjadeo integration in the build system:

 - add support for Qt4
 - pass xjadeo binary path to qjadeo at build time via -D option.

  DISPLAY:

 - fall back on a different video mode when one is not avail.
 - parse --vo option by names (no ints -> remove SUP_XXX stuff from display.c)
 - XV & SDL  multiple sessions...??  -> fall back to use different (non accelerated) video mode.

 - speed up YUV trancoding - rewrite "buffer" concept.
   have ffmpeg decode directly to shared-mem...

 - add some credits to http://libdv.sourceforge.net/  
   playdv source provided good inspiration for SDL and Xv.
 - keyboard events. (-> generate remote msgs)

 - check and fix for POSIX compliance 

  MIDI:
 - use alsamidi -> qjackctrl client (LATER - if at all)
 - make midi_eventloop standalone thread, or make midi buffer configurable

  REMOTE: 
 - some commands are 402: not yet implemented
 - notify key event
 - internal (default) key press handler if no-bidir remote ctrl.
 - map key event to command (dynamic or fixed ?!)

########

Support more video formats. Doubtful. It is difficult and taxes performance.

rewrite contrib/encode.sh and install files in contrib (include in deb/rpm)

rename "-fps" option - can be confusing: fps of the movie-file, and delay
between display-updates.

put xjadeo-session name in window title ? 

New Feature request / Brainstorm:
 - check cpu load - dynamically increase delay if above threshold.

 - allow dynamically adj. of offset.
   eg. press key '-' '+' sub/add a frame. (see note abvoe)
 - parse offset from EDL file 
 
 - libdv / libtheora / mjpeg  :)
