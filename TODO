TODO
----

* fix X11 - buffer when re-opening window.
  free (buffers) when closing window. (leak!)

* ratain aspect ratio  - letterbox option

* http://lash.nongnu.org/ support
  - fix , ignore '-R' when started by lash
    and think of a way to re-connect a remote session

  - qt-gui + LASH

  - save internal states (offset, fps, file-fps, etc.) 
    that can be changed via remote to lash.
  
  - remember window size + position

TODO - next major version: (backport xj5 branch)
------------------------------------------------
* exact sync
 decode one frame ahead and use
 Xv/Xext -> VSYNC raster interrupt to trigger double buffer flip

* optional: don't poll for jack-time but register as jack-audio client
  -> jack will call xjadeo

* modularize time-sync + video-source

* get rid of the goto's

* struct video-file-options;
  struct program-options;


TODO - legacy and older ideas
-----------------------------
  DISPLAY:

 - getwindow position 

 - SDL RGB SWSURFACE (new videomode)

 - speed up YUV trancoding - rewrite "buffer" concept.
   have ffmpeg decode directly to shared-mem...

 - keyboard events. (-> generate remote msgs)

 - freetype font config. outline font? color, xposition.

  MIDI:

 - portmidi: error handling (portmidi aborts on error)

 - jack midi 

  MAIN:

 - config file for our mighty jolly bunch of config options.

 - SMPTE support drop frames 

  REMOTE: 

 - some commands are 402: not yet implemented
 - notify key event
 - internal (default) key press handler if no-bidir remote ctrl.
 - map key event to command (dynamic or fixed ?!)


########

Support more video formats. Doubtful. It is difficult and taxes performance.

rename "-fps" option - can be confusing: fps of the movie-file, and delay
between display-updates.

put xjadeo-session name in window title ? 

New Feature request / Brainstorm:
 - check cpu load - dynamically increase delay if above threshold.

 - allow dynamic adj. of offset.
   eg. press key '-' '+' sub/add a frame. (see note abvoe)
 - parse offset from EDL file 
 
 - libdv / libtheora / mjpeg  :)
