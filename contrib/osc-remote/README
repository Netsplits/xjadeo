A simple 'script' that creates xjadeo remote ctrl
commands from OSC (and passes thru stdin).

It allows to seek to video frames - but has a non-fixed latency.
Nevertheless it works fine for most real-live applications (~1 frame delay);
but is intended for non-time-critical configuration options while using a
sync-source (jack-transport, MTC, LTC,..)

There's an example pure-data file vctl-osc.pd to demo it:

pd vctl-osc.pd &
make && ./osceo | ../../src/xjadeo/xjadeo -R -f 25 > /dev/null

For installations you may want to add `-K` and `-f 25` or `-f 75` 
to minimize jitter and latency  - or put it in ~/.xjadeorc 

have fun,
robin

PS. it's on the roadmap to include OSC directly into xjadeo but that may
or may not happen anytime soon.
