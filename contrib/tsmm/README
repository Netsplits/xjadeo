** PRE_RELEASE **

xjtsmm uses xjadeo's OSD code and libtiff to generate image sequences
with SMPTE and frame-number rendered on the frames. so far only @ 25 fps. 

This tool is intended to verify xjadeo's seeking accurancy and check
framerate converions... maybe later it can be used with xjadeo to 
render this information on existing video material.

This was more fun than reading imagemagick's manual...
