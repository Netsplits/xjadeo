counter part to xjadeo : jadio - jack audio monitor

A while ago I got annoyed to start up a GUI everytime to play a bounced file
in sync with jack_transport... and before I found ecasound I started hacking.

I've been using jadio is to experiement with various sound-libs and decoders
since. it's still messy and incomplete, but it can read and seek all of
xjadeo's supported files so I put it in the contrib folder.

try: 
  make
  ./jadio <file-name>

  edit jadio.c parametes section and recompile.
