A large part of the website / documentation is auto-generated.
This document gives quick overview, for details check out the Makefile.

Man Pages
---------

 * Are generated using `help2man`
 * actual text is from `usage()` and `printversion()` in
  ../src/xjadeo/main.c and ../src/xjadeo/xjremote.c
 * generated man pages should be commited to git with every release-tag
   (see also release.sh)

Website
-------
 * Is assembled by simple templates
 * man-pages are converted to html using `groff(1)`
 * 'raw' html page bodies are in ./pages/  -> *edit & commit these at will*
 * fixed page header/footer is in ./tpl (no need to touch)
 * static content (images, stylesheets,..) is in ./static/
   (the static folder is copied as-is)
 * run `make` (needs man-pages, `cat`, `sed`, `ed`, `bash`)
 * some pages are semi-autogenerated:
   - remote-control doc `pages/remote` -> see `./remotedoc.sh`
   - OSC doc -> see 'sed' line in src/xjadeo/xjosc.c

NB. `awk`, `grep` and `date` are needed to extract the version.
