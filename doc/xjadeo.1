.SH "NAME"
xjadeo \- displays a video clip in sync with an external timing source
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 7
\fBxjadeo\fR [\-abfFhikKLmMoqQRtvVx] [videofile]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBxjadeo\fR
displays a video clip in sync with an external timing source. It is a handy tool to help with the synchronization of the soundtrack of a video file.
\fBxjadeo\fR
supports different video file formats, video output libraries and sync sources.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-a, \-\-ontop\fR
.RS 3n
Start xjadeo on top of other windows. (affects XV videomode only).
.RE
.PP
\fB\-b, \-\-letterbox\fR
.RS 3n
retain aspect ratio and draw a letterbox around the move if necessary. Note that this feature is only available with the Xv video mode.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f, \-\-fps \fR\fB\fI<n>\fR\fR
.RS 3n
Desired refresh rate of the video display in frames per second. Lower values lighten the CPU load at the cost of video quality. Admits non\-integer values. Defaults to 10.0 fps.
.sp
If this value is set to zero (or less), xjadeo will use the framerate of the video file as its video update frequency.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-F, \-\-filefps \fR\fB\fI<n>\fR\fR
.RS 3n
Override the (autodetected) framerate of the videofile.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR
.RS 3n
Prints usage help and exits.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-i, \-\-info \fR\fB\fI<n>\fR\fR
.RS 3n
Displays useful info using the OSD (on\-screen display.)
.RS 3n
.PP
\fB0\fR
.RS 3n
Off.
.RE
.PP
\fB1\fR
.RS 3n
Frame number.
.RE
.PP
\fB2\fR
.RS 3n
SMPTE time code.
.RE
.PP
\fB3\fR
.RS 3n
Both frame number and SMPTE.
.RE
.RE
.IP "" 3n
The remote interface allows more complete control over the OSD.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-k, \-\-keyframes \fR
.RS 3n
Instructs the internal algorithm to seek only keyframes. This option may improve the performance for certain video encodings.
.sp
The default behaviour (without \-k and \-K arguments) is to search any ANY frame.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-K, \-\-continuous \fR
.RS 3n
Decode video frame by frame, particularly only useful to read files where not every frame is a keyframe at cost of CPU usage. Note that this option adds some extra latency when seeking. combine with
\fB\-f \fR: It makes sense to set xjadeo's framerate to equal the framerate of the video file.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-L, \-\-nolash\fR
.RS 3n
Disable LASH support.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-m, \-\-midi \fR\fB\fI<port>\fR\fR
.RS 3n
Get sync from MTC (MIDI Time Code) instead of jack.
.sp
If compiled with ALSA midi,
\fI<port>\fR
is the ALSA sequencer id of the MTC source. A value of \-1 will leave
\fBxjadeo\fR
unconnected.
.sp
If using portmidi,
\fI<port>\fR
is the portnumber of the midi input to use. value \-1 will attempt autoconnect. use \-v \-m \-1 to list midi ports during autodetection.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-M, \-\-midifps \fR\fB\fI<n>\fR\fR
.RS 3n
Conversion between MTC SMPTE and frame number.
.RS 3n
.PP
\fB0\fR
.RS 3n
Use MTC clock frame rate.
.RE
.PP
\fB2\fR
.RS 3n
Use video file frame rate.
.RE
.PP
\fB3\fR
.RS 3n
Resample video frame rate / MTC.
.RE
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-o, \-\-offset \fR\fB\fI<n>\fR\fR
.RS 3n
Offset the video player a certain number of (video) frames relative to the sync master time base. Admits negative values.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-q, \-\-quiet, \-\-silent\fR
.RS 3n
Suppresses normal output messages.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-Q, \-\-mq\fR
.RS 3n
Enable POSIX message queues. Sets up a communication channel for use with
xjremote(1). See the
the section called \(lqRemote Control Interface\(rq
in the documentation.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-R, \-\-remote\fR
.RS 3n
Enables interactive (stdin/stdout) control mode. Options
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
and
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
have no effect in remote mode.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t, \-\-try\-codec\fR
.RS 3n
Checks if the video file is encoded in a format suitable for use with
\fBxjadeo\fR
and exits. If the video format is not supported the exit code is 1.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fR
.RS 3n
Prints additional information during the execution.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-V, \-\-version\fR
.RS 3n
Display version and compile\-time configuration information and exit.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-x, \-\-vo, \-\-videomode \fR\fB\fI<n>\fR\fR
.RS 3n
Selects the video output driver. Defaults to 0 (autodetect.) A value of \-1 makes the program list the available drivers and exit.
.RE
.SH "SYNC SOURCES"
.PP
\fBxjadeo\fR
currently supports the following synchronization sources:
.TP 3n
\(bu
Jack transport.
.TP 3n
\(bu
MTC (MIDI Time Code) via ALSA sequencer.
.TP 3n
\(bu
MTC (MIDI Time Code) via portmidi.
.SH "VIDEO DRIVERS"
.PP
\fBxjadeo\fR
currently supports the following video output drivers:
.TP 3n
\(bu
xv (YUV / YV12)
.TP 3n
\(bu
SDL (YUV / YV12)
.TP 3n
\(bu
ImLib (RGB / RGBA)
.SH "VIDEO FORMATS"
.PP
\fBxjadeo\fR
uses the ffmpeg libraries to decode video files, so a wide range of codecs is available. Note, however, that not all the formats support frame seeking. You can use a command like:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
mencoder \-idx \-ovc lavc \-lavcopts keyint=1 \-nosound input_file.xxx \-o output_file.avi
.fi
.RE
.PP
This creates from your input\-file.xxx an AVI mpeg4 encoded video file with no sound, an index (\-idx) and no compression between frames (every frame is a keyframe). The file thus can become really BIG, so watch out your disk space.
.PP
You may also want to shrink the size of the frame by adding the option
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
\-vf scale=width:height
.fi
.RE
.PP
This will reduce the size of the avi file, will tax less the system resources when displayed and will leave more space in the screen for your audio software.
.SH "USER INPUT"
.PP
\fBxjadeo\fR
window accepts the following input:
.TP 3n
\(bu
Resizing the window will resize the movie as well. (CAVEAT: resizing a video frame to make it fit the window is a CPU expensive operation unless you are using hardware overlay. If you are not comfortable with the frame size of your movie it is more CPU efficient that you re\-encode the video file with the desired size beforehand.)
.TP 3n
\(bu
Pressing mouse button 1 will resize the window to the original movie size.
.TP 3n
\(bu
Mouse button 2 and 3 resize the window to match the movie aspect ratio.
.TP 3n
\(bu
Scroll Wheel (buttons 4,5) stepwise decreases/increases the window size maintaining the original aspect ratio.
.TP 3n
\(bu
Closing the window or pressing ctrl\-C will terminate
\fBxjadeo\fR.
.TP 3n
\(bu
xjadeo >= v0.3.8 supports keyboard events. Pressing 'Esc' and 'q' will end the program. depending on your display setup xjadeo supports 'f' toggle fullscreen, 'a' toggle always\-on\-top and 'm' to hide mouse cursor keystrokes.
.SH "REMOTE MODE"
.PP
\fBxjadeo \-Q\fR
enables message queues; use
\fBxjremote\fR
to connect.
.PP
When started in remote mode (option
\fB\-R\fR
or
\fB\-\-remote\fR)
\fBxjadeo\fR
will interactively accept commands and issue responses through its standard input/output mechanism.
.PP
Use the remote command
\fBhelp\fR
to get a quick overview of all available commands. please refer to the docbook documentation for a complete description of the remote commands.
.SH "FILES"
.PP
xjadeo reads the following resource config files in this order:
.TP 3n
1.
/@SYSCONFDIR@/xjadeorc (usually /etc/xjadeorc or /usr/local/etc/xjadeorc, depends on settings when
building xjadeo)
.TP 3n
2.
$HOME/.xjadeorc
.TP 3n
3.
$HOME/xjadeorc
.PP
Each line in the config file must be in in the format:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
KEY=VALUE
.fi
.RE
.sp
. If the first character on a line is either '#' or ';'. the line is ignored.
\fBKEYS\fR
are not case sensitive.
\fBVALUES\fR
can be case sensitive (fi. filenames) and are parsed identical to the corresponding command line arguments (eg.
\fB\-x SDL\fR
becomes
\fBvideomode=SDL\fR). Boolean values are specified as 'yes' or 'no' (eg.
\fBquiet=yes\fR).
.PP
currently supported rc KEYS: fps, fontfile, lash, mq, quiet, seek, verbose and videomode.
